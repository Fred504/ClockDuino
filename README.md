Clock Project with Arduino DS3231 RTC and 4 digit LED display

This is really a fork off of Arduino_Play, the ChronoDot_20141027 directory

I'm going to modify it to use the watchdog timer to only run the processor 2 times/second,

Then I will modify it with a Pro mini to use as little power as possible

New Change
